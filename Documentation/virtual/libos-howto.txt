Library operating system (libos) version of Linux
=================================================

* Overview

New hardware independent architecture 'arch/lib', configured by
CONFIG_LIB gives you two features.

- network stack in userspace (NUSE)
- network simulator integration, which is called Direct Code Execution
  (DCE)
(- more abstracted rump hypercall implementation will be a future
   direction)

In both features, Linux kernel network stack is running on top of
userspace application with a linked or dynamically loaded library.

They have their own, isolated network stack from host operating system
so they are configured different IP addresses as other virtualization
methods do.

* Install

configuration of arch/lib follows a standard configuration of kernel.

 make defconfig ARCH=lib

or

 make menuconfig ARCH=lib

then you can build a set of libraries for libos.

 make library ARCH=lib

* Hello world

you may first need to configure a configuration file, named
'nuse.conf' so that the library version of network stack can know what
kind of IP configuration should be used.

 sudo NUSECONF=nuse.conf ./nuse ping 172.16.0.2


* Features
- per-userspace application network stack
- netmap support
- intel dpdk support


* Setup

* Files

files sim*.[c] indicate to relate to simulator via Direct Code
Execution (DCE), files nuse*.[ch] indicate to relate to Network Stack
in Userspace (NUSE). other files are shared functions between them.
