MediaTek AUXADC
===============

The Auxiliary Analog/Digital Converter (AUXADC) is an ADC found
in some Mediatek SoCs which among other things measures the temperatures
in the SoC. It can be used directly with register accesses, but it is also
used by thermal controller which reads the temperatures from the AUXADC
directly via its own bus interface. See
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/mediatek-thermal.txt
for the Thermal Controller which holds a phandle to the AUXADC.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "mediatek,mt8173-auxadc"
- reg: Address range of the AUXADC unit

Example:

auxadc: auxadc@11001000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-auxadc";
	reg = <0 0x11001000 0 0x1000>;
};
