Device Tree Bindings for the Arasan SDHCI Controller

  The bindings follow the mmc[1], clock[2], interrupt[3] and phy[4] bindings.
  Only deviations are documented here.

Required Properties:
  - compatible: Compatibility string. Must be 'arasan,sdhci-8.9a' or
                'arasan,sdhci-4.9a' or 'arasan,sdhci-5.1'
  - reg: From mmc bindings: Register location and length.
  - clocks: From clock bindings: Handles to clock inputs.
  - clock-names: From clock bindings: Tuple including "clk_xin" and "clk_ahb"
  - interrupts: Interrupt specifier
  - interrupt-parent: Phandle for the interrupt controller that services
		      interrupts for this device.

Required Properties for "arasan,sdhci-5.1":
  - phys: From PHY bindings: Phandle for the Generic PHY for arasan.
  - phy-names:  MUST be "phy_arasan".

Example:
	sdhci@e0100000 {
		compatible = "arasan,sdhci-8.9a";
		reg = <0xe0100000 0x1000>;
		clock-names = "clk_xin", "clk_ahb";
		clocks = <&clkc 21>, <&clkc 32>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 24 4>;
	} ;

	sdhci@e2800000 {
		compatible = "arasan,sdhci-5.1";
		reg = <0xe2800000 0x1000>;
		clock-names = "clk_xin", "clk_ahb";
		clocks = <&cru 8>, <&cru 18>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 24 4>;
		phys = <&emmc_phy>;
		phy-names = "phy_arasan";
	} ;
