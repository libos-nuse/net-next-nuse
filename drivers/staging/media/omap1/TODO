This driver is deprecated and will be removed soon unless someone will start
the work to convert this driver to the vb2 framework and remove the
soc-camera dependency.

Note that trivial patches will not be accepted anymore, only a full conversion.

If you want to convert this driver, please contact the linux-media mailinglist
(see http://linuxtv.org/lists.php).
