* Fix pad format size for statistics and parameters entities.
* Fix checkpatch errors.
* Add uapi docs. Remember to add documentation of how quantization is handled.
* streaming paths (mainpath and selfpath) check if the other path is streaming
in several places of the code, review this, specially that it doesn't seem it
supports streaming from both paths at the same time.

NOTES:
* All v4l2-compliance test must pass.
* Stats and params can be tested with libcamera and ChromiumOS stack.
