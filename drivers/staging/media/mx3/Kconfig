	  This is a v4l2 driver for the i.MX3x Camera Sensor Interface

	  This driver is deprecated: it should become a stand-alone driver
	  instead of using the soc-camera framework.

	  Unless someone is willing to take this on (unlikely with such
	  ancient hardware) it is going to be removed from the kernel
	  soon.
