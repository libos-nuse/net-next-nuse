This driver is deprecated: it should become a stand-alone driver instead of
using the soc-camera framework.

Unless someone is willing to take this on (unlikely with such ancient
hardware) it is going to be removed from the kernel soon.

Note that trivial patches will not be accepted anymore, only a full conversion.

If you want to convert this driver, please contact the linux-media mailinglist
(see http://linuxtv.org/lists.php).
